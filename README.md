# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
Big mart sales prediction is done by using linear, ridge, lasso regression algorithms.

## Overview:
We are going to predict the Item_outlet_sales and our aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.

## Outlet Type:

## Conclusion:
In this project, we tried to build a model using algorithms such as Linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, BayesianRidge regression and HuberRegressor to get the best possible prediction.
